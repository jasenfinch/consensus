> Consensus Structural Chemical Classifications For Putative Molecular Formula Assignments of *m/z* Features from ESI-MS

## Overview

This R package provides an approach for compiling consensus structural chemical classifications of putative molecular formulas assigned to *m/z* features from electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) approaches. 
Putative ionisation products can be searched against the [KEGG compound database](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/compound/) and/or [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to identify candidate compounds.
These candidate compounds are then searched against the [ClassyFire](http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/) database from which a consensus structural chemical classification is calculated.

## Installation

The `construction` package can be installed from GitHub using the
following:

```
remotes::install_github('jasenfinch/construction')
```
